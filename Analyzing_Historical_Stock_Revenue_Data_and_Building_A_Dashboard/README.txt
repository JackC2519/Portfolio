The project above was completed as the final project of the IBM Python Project for Data Science course on Coursera.

The aim of the project was to showcase our skills in using Python Web Scraping tools in order to acquire and store basic stock data in a data frame where it will then be displayed in a graph comparing the companies stock value versus revenue over a period of time 

Unfortunately the graphs apart of questions 5 and 6 do not show when you view the file but it ran in a Python environment they will appear as intended
